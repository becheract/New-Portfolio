# A statically generated blog example using Next.js and Sanity

This example showcases Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as the data source.

You'll get:

- Next.js deployed with the [Sanity Vercel Integration][integration].
- Sanity Studio running on localhost and deployed in the [cloud](https://www.sanity.io/docs/deployment).
- Sub-second as-you-type previews in Next.js
- [On-demand revalidation of pages](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1#on-demand-incremental-static-regeneration-beta) with [GROQ powered webhooks](https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks)

## Step 1. Set up the environment

Use the Deploy Button below, you'll deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) as well as connect it to your Sanity dataset using [the Sanity Vercel Integration][integration].

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) that Vercel created for you and from the root directory of your local checkout.
Then link your clone to Vercel:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and Studio to your Sanity project:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

<details>
<summary>You can also set up manually</summary>

- [Bootstrap the example](#bootstrap-the-example)
- [Connect to a Sanity project](#connect-to-a-sanity-project)
- [Set up environment variables](#set-up-environment-variables)

If using the [integration] isn't an option. Or maybe you want to work locally first and deploy to Vercel later. Whatever the reason this guide shows you how to setup manually.

### Bootstrap the example

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
npx create-next-app --example cms-sanity cms-sanity-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example cms-sanity cms-sanity-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example cms-sanity cms-sanity-app
```

### Connect to a Sanity project

Run this to select from your existing Sanity projects, or create a new one:

```bash
(cd studio && npx @sanity/cli init)
```

The CLI will update [`sanity.json`] with the project ID and dataset name.

### Set up environment variables

Copy the [`.env.local.example`] file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then set these variables in `.env.local`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` should be the `projectId` value from [`sanity.json`].
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` should be the `dataset` value from [`sanity.json`].
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` create an API token with `read-only` permissions:
  - Run this to open your project settings or go to https://manage.sanity.io/ and open your project:
    ```bash
    (cd studio && npx @sanity/cli manage)
    ```
  - Go to **API** and the **Tokens** section at the bottom, launch its **Add API token** button.
  - Name it `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`, set **Permissions** to `Viewer`.
  - Hit **Save** and you can copy/paste the token.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=...
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=...
```

</details>

## Step 2. Configure CORS for localhost

Needed for live previewing unpublished/draft content.

```bash
npm --prefix studio run cors:add -- http://localhost:3000 --credentials
```

## Step 3. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).

## Step 4. Populate content

In another terminal start up the studio:

```bash
npm run studio:dev
```

Your studio should be up and running on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)!

Create content in Sanity Studio and live preview it in Next.js, side-by-side, by opening these URLs:

- [`http://localhost:3333`](http://localhost:3333)
- [`http://localhost:3000/api/preview`](http://localhost:3000/api/preview)

  </details>

- Create a couple more **Posts** and watch how the layout adapt to more content.

**Important:** For each post record, you need to click **Publish** after saving for it to be visible outside Preview Mode.

To exit Preview Mode, you can click on _"Click here to exit preview mode"_ at the top.

## Step 5. Deploy to production & use Preview Mode from anywhere

### If you didn't [Deploy with Vercel earlier](#step-1-set-up-the-environment) do so now

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).

**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.

After it's deployed link your local code to the Vercel project:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

### Configure CORS for production

Add your `production url` to the list over CORS origins.

<details>
<summary>Don't remember the production url? ðŸ¤”</summary>

No worries, it's easy to find out. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/) and click on your project:

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81981/183002637-6aa6b1d8-e0ee-4a9b-bcc0-d49799fcc984.png)

In the screenshot above the `production url` is `https://cms-sanity.vercel.app`.

</details>

```bash
npm --prefix studio run cors:add -- [your production url] --credentials
```

### Add the preview secret environment variable

It's required to set a secret that makes Preview Mode activation links unique. Otherwise anyone could see your unpublished content by just opening `[your production url]/api/preview`.
Run this and it'll prompt you for a value:

```bash
npx vercel env add SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET
```

The secret can be any combination of random words and letters as long as it's URL safe.
You can generate one in your DevTools console using `copy(Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 10))` if you don't feel like inventing one.

You should see something like this in your terminal afterwards:

```bash
$ npx vercel env add SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET
Vercel CLI 27.3.7
? Whatâ€™s the value of SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET? 2whpu1jefs
? Add SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET to which Environments (select multiple)? Production, Preview, Development
âœ…  Added Environment Variable SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET to Project cms-sanity [1s]
```

Redeploy production to apply the secret to the preview api:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

After it deploys it should now start preview mode if you launch `[your production url]/api/preview?secret=[your preview secret]`. You can send that preview url to people you want to show the content you're working on before you publish it.

### How to test locally that the secret is setup correctly

In order to test that the secret will prevent unauthorized people from activating preview mode, start by updating the local `.env` with the secret you just made:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

Restart your Next.js and Studio processes so the secret is applied:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run studio:dev
```

And now you'll get an error if `[secret]` is incorrect when you try to open `https://localhost:3000/api/preview?secret=[secret]`.

### How to start Preview Mode for Next.js in production from a local Studio

Run this to make the Studio open previews at `[your production url]/api/preview` instead of `http://localhost:3000/api/preview`

```bash
SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL=[your production url] npm run studio:dev
```

### If you regret sending a preview link to someone

Revoke their access by creating a new secret:

```bash
npx vercel env rm SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET
npx vercel env add SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET
npx vercel --prod
```

## Step 6. Deploy your Studio and publish from anywhere

Live previewing content is fun, but collaborating on content in real-time is next-level:

```bash
SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL=[your production url] npm run studio:deploy
```

If it's successful you should see something like this in your terminal:

```bash
SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL="https://cms-sanity.vercel.app" npm run studio:deploy
? Studio hostname (<value>.sanity.studio): cms-sanity

Including the following environment variables as part of the JavaScript bundle:
- SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL
- SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET
- SANITY_STUDIO_API_PROJECT_ID
- SANITY_STUDIO_API_DATASET

âœ” Deploying to Sanity.Studio

Success! Studio deployed to https://cms-sanity.sanity.studio/
```

This snippet is stripped from verbose information, you'll see a lot of extra stuff in your terminal.

## Step 7. Setup Revalidation Webhook

Using GROQ Webhooks Next.js can rebuild pages that have changed content. It rebuilds so fast it can almost compete with Preview Mode.

Create a secret and give it a value the same way you did for `SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_SECRET` in [Step 4](#add-the-preview-secret-environment-variable). It's used to verify that webhook payloads came from Sanity infra, and set it as the value for `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET`:

```bash
npx vercel env add SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET
```

You should see something like this in your terminal afterwards:

```bash
$ npx vercel env add SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET
Vercel CLI 27.3.7
? Whatâ€™s the value of SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET? jwh3nr85ft
? Add SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET to which Environments (select multiple)? Production, Preview, Development
âœ…  Added Environment Variable SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET to Project cms-sanity [1s]
```

Apply the secret to production:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Wormhole into the [manager](https://manage.sanity.io/) by running:

```bash
(cd studio && npx @sanity/cli hook create)
```

- **Name** it "On-demand Revalidation".
- Set the **URL** to`[your production url]/api/revalidate`, for example: `https://cms-sanity.vercel.app/api/revalidate`
- Set the **Trigger on** field to <label><input type=checkbox checked> Create</label> <label><input type=checkbox checked> Update</label> <label><input type=checkbox checked> Delete</label>
- Set the **Filter** to `_type == "post" || _type == "author"`
- Set the **Secret** to the same value you gave `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` earlier.
- Hit **Save**!

### Testing the Webhook

- Open the Deployment function log. (**Vercel Dashboard > Deployment > Functions** and filter by `api/revalidate`)
- Edit a Post in your Sanity Studio and publish.
- The log should start showing calls.
- And the published changes show up on the site after you reload.

## Next steps

- Mount your preview inside the Sanity Studio for comfortable side-by-side editing
