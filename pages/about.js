              My name is Bechera, and I'm a full-stack web developer based in
              Canada. my love for coding first took shape in the form of video
              games, I was interested in the design process of games, like level
              design, and how they were created. My parents then pushed me
              towards learning how to make video games. I used game engines like
              unity, unreal engine, and game Maker studio. I was then enrolled
              in multiple coding boot camps where I learned Java, HTML, CSS and
              Javascript.

              I really found a passion in the design process of creating
              websites, as I found myself being compelled to try and make a
              website look as good as possible and also admiring other websites'
              designs. I then proceeded to take coding and computer classes
              throughout high school and then continued with coding in college
              where I enrolled in the Internet Applications and Web Development
              course and learned about CMS, configuring web servers, Linux,
              mobile applications and game development, and graphic design.
