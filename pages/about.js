              Hello and welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Bechera, and I
              am a full-stack web developer with a passion for coding and
              teaching others. I've been coding since I was 14 years old, and I
              have always loved the challenge and creativity that comes with
              writing code. Throughout high school, I took coding classes that
              helped me to build a strong foundation in various programming
              languages. After high school, I pursued my passion for coding by
              attending college to become a full-stack web developer. During my
              time in college, I learned a variety of programming languages such
              as Javascript, PHP, MySQL, and Linux, among others. I was able to
              put my knowledge into practice through various coding projects and
              internships, which further enhanced my skills and experience.

              Upon graduating from college, I landed a job as a lead developer
              for a non-profit organization that specialized in teaching people
              of all ages about AI and machine learning. Here, I was able to
              work on exciting projects such as video games, microcontrollers,
              and servers, among others. It was a fulfilling experience, and I
              gained valuable insight into how technology can be used to impact
              lives positively. I also worked as a freelance WordPress teacher
              for Code Youth, teaching at-risk youth how to code. I found this
              work very rewarding as I got to make a positive impact on the
              lives of young people while sharing my knowledge and passion for
              coding. I am excited to continue to learn, grow, and explore the
              world of coding, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded
              individuals who share my passion. Thank you for visiting my
              portfolio site, and I hope you find something that sparks your
              interest.
