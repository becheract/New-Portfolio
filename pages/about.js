              Hello and welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Bechera, and I
              am a full-stack web developer with a passion for coding and
              teaching others. I've been coding since I was 14 years old, and I
              have always loved the challenge and creativity that comes with
              writing code. Throughout high school, I took coding classes that
              helped me to build a strong foundation in various programming
              languages. After high school, I pursued my passion for coding by
              attending college to become a full-stack web developer. During my
              time in college, I learned a variety of programming languages such
              as Javascript, PHP, MySQL, and Linux, among others. I was able to
              put my knowledge into practice through various coding projects and
              internships, which further enhanced my skills and experience.

              Upon graduating from college, I landed a job as a lead developer
              for a non-profit organization that specialized in teaching people
              of all ages about AI and machine learning. Here, I was able to
              work on exciting projects such as video games, microcontrollers,
              and servers, among others. It was a fulfilling experience, and I
              gained valuable insight into how technology can be used to impact
              lives positively. Currently, I am working as a freelance WordPress
              teacher for another organization, teaching at-risk youth how to
              code. I find this work very rewarding as I get to make a positive
              impact on the lives of young people while sharing my knowledge and
              passion for coding. I am excited to continue to learn, grow, and
              explore the world of coding, and I look forward to connecting with
              like-minded individuals who share my passion. Thank you for
              visiting my portfolio site, and I hope you find something that
              sparks your interest.
